# Captain Rex Antenna

Based on models from the [Galactic Armory](https://galacticarmory.net/collections/3d-files/products/animated-captain-rex-helmet-3d-print-files).

I modified the models to allow clearance for wires, and the LEDs.

This is the (very minimal) code to animate the LEDs.

## Video Examples
